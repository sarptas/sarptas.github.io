Abstract
======

Assessment of the spatial distribution of forest biomass, which is the most important biomass source
in terms of potential in Turkey, has a critical prospect for monitoring biomass stocks and determining
the technical and economic feasibility of energy production projects from forest biomass. The
integration of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) with Remote Sensing (RS) technique, which
provides significant advantages according to land measurements and calculations such as age, height,
diameter and trunk volume for each individual tree in forest inventories, provides a more
comprehensive and faster biomass potential estimation. For this respect, this study aims to develop a
method integrating GIS and RS techniques for the estimation (mapping) of forest biomass potential
and to implement it in a case study area. Within the scope of the study, above-ground biomass
potential for Bergama İncecikler Forestry Area has been determined by IPCC method.
