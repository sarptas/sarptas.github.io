Abstract
=======

Methane emission from landfilling of waste is one of the most prevalent gascontributingto the greenhouse effect. Current  waste  management  strategies,aimtoreducemethane  emissions  from  landfills,promote  energy recovery  from landfillgas  (LFG)  that  is  recognized  as  a  renewable  energy  resource,  due  to  its  higher  calorific value.First and the most crucialstage in the planning and design of LFG collection and energy recovery systems is  to  quantifyLFG  generation.It’s because, the  quantity  of  LFG  and  its  methane  content  determine both the applicable  method  for  the  control  and  use  of  LFG  and  the  feasibility  of  energy  recovery.LFG  models  are developedfor the projection of LFG generation over time from a mass of landfilled waste. During planning and projection phase of a landfill, the amountof gas that will be generated and recovered at the sitecan be estimated –based on projected amounts of waste –by only using these models.Due to complex nature of LFG formation, several models have been developedto model and estimate LFG generationwith different approachesfor regions in different climates.In a  LFG  energy recovery project,selectionof the  appropriate  modeling approach and its model  parameters  for  the  estimation  of  LFG  generationis  the  most  crucial  step.  With  considering  this requirement,  this  study  aims  to estimatethe  amount  of  LFG  and itstechnical energy  potential  from the  case study  landfill site(i.e. Harmandalı  Landfill Site  in  İzmir  Metropolitan  City).According  to  the computationscarried  out  by  Multi-phase  model, it  was  determined  that the  remaining amountof LFG  at  the  site was  nearly 50% of total energy potential. Besides,maximum energy potential from LFG generated at the site was estimated as 9.6 MW.This study indicates that LFG models can be utilized as effective tools in energy recovery projects.
