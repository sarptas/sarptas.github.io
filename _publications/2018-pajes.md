Abstract
======

The Earth is in an era, when the natural balance has been deteriorated by  the  human  and  the  adverse  effects  have  been  increased  by  these deteriorations.  The  adverse  effects  of  global  climate  change  have  no limitations, and if these effects are overlooked by the human, they shall spread  to  all  areas  rapidly.  The  plants,  which  are  so  important  for  all living  creatures,  shall  be  faced  with  deaths,  migrations  or  adaptation challenges  in  thefuture  because  of  the  climate  change-originated geographical  alteration  on  the  variables  such  as  air  temperature  and precipitation.    These    reasons    make   essential    the    estimations    of geographical  distribution  of  plants  in  the  future.  In  the  study,  the geographic-climatic   suitability   of   maize,   safflower,   canola   (rape), cotton, wheat and switchgrass was projected for 2070, and the current and  future  conditions  were  compared.  The  applied  steps  in  the  study are;  (1)  the  climatic  data -obtained  from  Worldclim  as current  and 2070-projected data, (2) the identification of essential temperature and precipitation intervals for crops’ growth from EcoCrop, (3) application of the Climate Change Adaptation Modeler (CCAM)’s sub-model “Crop Climatic   Suitability   Modeling   (CCSM)”  in  TerrSet,  a  Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing software by Clark Labs, and finally (4) generation of the climatic suitability maps for each crop for  current  and  future.  With  this  study,  the  climate-based  geographic suitabilityof  plants  was  evaluated  for  Turkey  where  is  dominated  by Mediterranean    climate    pattern    as    41.1%in  Köppen  Climate Classification.  In  the  study,  the  projected  areal  suitability  of  maize, switchgrass  and  cotton  shall  not  change  significantly  according  to current  conditions.  Safflower’s  and  canola’s  areal  suitability  shall expand   and   displace,   respectively.   Here,   the   major   loser   in   areal suitability  shall  be  wheat  in  Turkey.  The  methodology  may  aid  for planners   and   land   managers   to   understand   changes   in   climatic suitability of plants from present to future.
