Abstract
======

In this study, an innovative approach was carried out using the geographic information systems (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation model to assign the use priority in agricultural lands needing to be improved for management and sustainability of biochar application in the soil. The model included (1) site suitability assessments, (2) standardization of assessment factors, and (3) equal-weighted overlay. By this model, the first map of primary biochar application areas for Turkey was prepared. As a result, the suitability scores were divided into five classes in the range of 0.20–0.90, and thus, the areas were found mostly in the moderate suitability (between 0.49 and 0.64). Consequently, it was determined that the biochar application was very highly suitable in the Aegean and Marmara regions. While the western and central parts of the Mediterranean region had high suitability, Central Anatolia and Southeastern Anatolia regions had very low suitability. The study results also indicated that the requirement for biochar addition was very low in the arable agricultural areas such as Harran in the Southeastern Anatolia region, Çukurova in the Mediterranean region, and Konya and Amasya in the Central Anatolia region. However, there is a need for showing particular attention to the agricultural areas of the Aegean Region, Ergene in the Marmara Region, and Iğdır in the Eastern Anatolian region due to higher biochar need for intensive agriculture.
