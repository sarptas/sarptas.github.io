Hi! I’m Hasan, an Assistant Professor at [Ege University](https://ege.edu.tr/), in the [Solar Energy Institute](https://eusolar.ege.edu.tr/). I’m an environmental engineer; and my primary study areas include waste management, waste-to-energy, climate change and renewable energy. I have just enough expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, decision making / analysis, programming and data science. I also deal with web design (HTML, CSS, and Wordpress) and graphic design (Inkscape and GIMP).

My work and research
=======

I use geographic information systems, remote sensing and decision analysis techniques to investigate sustainable potentials of renewable energy resources (solar, wind and biomass energy) and environmentally-sound planning of waste management facilities, solar farms, wind farms and biorefineries. I have a particular focus on climate change impacts on energy demand (heating and cooling degree days) and renewable energy. I’ve also studied on water supply projects, including the design of water supply systems and hydraulic modeling of water distribution systems by [EPANET](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet).

My background and history
======

I received my PhD and my MSc from Environmental Technology Program at Dokuz Eylül University, and my BSc from Environmental Engineering Department of Dokuz Eylül University. Two years after receiving my BSc, I've started to work at the Environmental Engineering Department of Dokuz Eylül University as a research assistant. I've worked at the Department of Environmental Engineering between 1997  to 2013 and taken a part of various research projects and assisted education efforts. Wastewater treatment, water supply, drinking water treatment and solid waste management were my main study areas at the department.

Software
=======

I'm fan of Linux operation systems and currently use [Manjaro Linux - KDE](https://manjaro.org/) and [LinuxMint](https://linuxmint.com/). I use [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), [SAGA GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/), and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for my professional studies. ArcGIS Pro, TerrSet, ENVI and MATLAB are other software packages I use for my works.
